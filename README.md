# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We used the kickstarter data set that was gathered to create our analysis and visualize the data. 

This project uses the Microsoft Excel tools to create two technical analysis and writing skills to write a written report based on analysis and visualization created. Will use the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their lauch dates and their funding goals. 

This project will consits of two technical analysis deliverables and a writen report to deliver the results.
• Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
• Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
• Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the kickstarter data set first we created a new column "Year" and used the Year function to extract the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column. This was required as this would made it easy for us to analyize theater outcomes by specific year. After extracting the data we created to pivot table to portray the campaign outcomes in a tabular fashion.

After showing the result in tabular way and to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month we created a line chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Using the Kickstarter data sheet, first we created a new sheet labeled "Outcomes Based on Loals" where we created bunch if rows and columns. Then we used some functions to extract data from the  kickstarter dataset and recorded in our new sheet.

Using the table created, we created a line chart to visualize the relationship between goal-amount ranges and outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges faced were to learn new functions like countifs to extract the data. To overcome the challenge I looked up some of the examples and watched some videos to understand it better and apply the knowledge I learned to finish my project.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  
  Two conclusions we can draw is:
  1. The best month to launch theater is in the month of may.
  2. The bad month to lauch theter is in the month of december.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  
  We can conclude that artist with goals of less than 1000 had a higher succesful percentage and artist with goals of 45000 to 49999 had a 100% failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

   Some limitations of this dataset could be that we could have inconsistencies or errors in the data. We might have duplicates or outliers in the data. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

   We could have created tables and graph of other category except of theater. Creating tables and graph of different categories we could have distinguish which category is most popular.
